# AI-Powered-Fraud-Detection-in-Auditing

---

## üß† Tech Stack

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Followed

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loaded the dataset and handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created custom features like transaction frequency, time patterns, and amount distribution

3. **Model Building**
   - Used Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning
   - Split dataset into training and test sets (80/20)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC
   - 10-fold cross-validation for robustness

5. **Results Interpretation**
   - Achieved high recall (1.00) ensuring zero false negatives
   - Balanced precision and recall for real-time fraud flagging

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Implement real-time API with FastAPI
- Deploy using Power BI or Streamlit for live dashboards
- Extend to anomaly detection for internal audit automation
